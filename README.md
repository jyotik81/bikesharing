# bikesharing

**Overview of the project

There is business proposal for investors which is bike-sharing program in Des Moines. To solidfy this proposal, bike trip analysis needs to be performed. 

That is why , I created set of visualizations to :

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

** Sources 

Data Source : 
These visualizations are created by using following resources 

NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb, 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
Data Tools : Jupyter Notebook,Tableau, cSV
Software : Jupyter Notebook & VS Code

Performed following three deliverables -

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

Used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. After conversion "tripduration" to a datetime datatype, exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

Final result looks as below :

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

In this visualization, I graphed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.
Final result looks as below : 


Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
